## Commands and History
- Realise I made my Manjaro installation partion the /home mount for Debian 10... whoops ***WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS LATER***

- reboot

- add contrib and non-free to sources
- `$ sudo apt update`
- `$ sudo apt install nvidia-detect`
- install package recommended by nvidia-detect (this case was `$ sudo apt install nvidia-driver`)
- say "okay" to nouveau warning
- reboot

---- note: oh thank god that's so much less laggy ----

---- note: from now on referring to "fresh debian 9 install steps" repo for setting up the basics

- connect PS3 controller via USB
- confirm prompt for connection
- test at https://html5gamepad.com/ (it's working perfectly out-of-the-box, god bless Debian)
- unplug USB
- press home button and test bluetooth support is working automatically (it is thank god)

- Gnome settings > Online Accounts (Add any relevant accounts)
- Gnome settings > Privacy > Location Services (turn on)
- Gnome settings > Sharing (enable)
- Gnome settings > Sharing > Computer Name (change this if it's not clear enough)
- Gnome settings > Devices > Displays > Night Light (turn it on)
- Gnome settings > Devices > Keyboard > "+" [scroll way down] (add these: Ctrl + Alt + T = gnome-terminal; Super + E = nautilus -w)
- Gnome settings > Details > Date & Time > Time Format (change to AM / PM)

- Tweak tool settings > Appearance > Themes > Applications (change to Adwaita-dark)

- Install gnome extensions
	- install drop down terminal
- Configure gnome extensions
	- [wip, refer to original install step repo at https://github.com/DrTexxOfficial/fresh-debian-install-steps for answers now]

- `$ sudo apt install apt-listbugs apt-listchanges`
- `$ sudo apt install snapd git gparted`

Configure flatpak
- `$ sudo apt install flatpak`
- `$ sudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak`
- `$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`
- reboot

Install some flatpak apps
- `$ flatpak install flathub io.atom.Atom` (Atom Text Editor)
- `$ flatpak install flathub com.spotify.Client` (Spotify)

Install and configure steam
- `$ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386` (enable 32bit package support)
- `$ sudo apt update`
- ensure (or be sure) that your graphics driver is installed and that non-free is in your /etc/apt/sources.list file
- `$ sudo apt install steam`
- `$ sudo apt install nvidia-driver-libs-i386` (_"For full functionality (including Vulkan), also install the libraries listed as Recommends in the nvidia-driver-libs-i386 package"_)
- reboot
- login to steam and add a new library at ~/SteamLibrary-4TB
- delete ~/SteamLibrary-4TB/steamapps folder
- mount the 4TB drive by clicking it in nautilus and entering password as required
- `$ ln -s /media/denver/DEN_HDD_4TB/Steam-Linux/steamapps ~/SteamLibrary-4TB/steamapps`
- relaunch steam

- learn the hard way that Beat Hazard 2 will not launch via any version of Proton if it is installed on the 4TB using this method, however it will work if the install files are moved to ~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps (moved via steam's game properties GUI with "MOVE INSTALL FOLDER..." under the "LOCAL FILES" tab). Is this the case for all proton games? Is it all proton versions? Further testing required.

- create a new repo for this file on github.com
- `$ mkdir ~/github`
- `$ cd ~/github`
- brief intermission, configure ssh for git and github.com ([more info](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh))
- `$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<github-private-commit-email>"` (generate a new key)
- `$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` (start the ssh-agent in the background)
- `$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa` (_"Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent"_)
- `$ sudo apt install xclip` (install xclip for copying the SSH key to clipboard)
- `$ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (copy SSH key to clipboard to later paste at github.com)
- head to your settings and paste in the new ssh key
- okay back to the repo for this file
- `$ git clone git@github.com:DrTexxOfficial/debian-10-install-history.git`
- more fun git configuration before we commit and push
- `$ git config --global user.email "<github-private-commit-email>"`
- `$ git config --global user.name "DrTexxOfficial"`

Beat Hazard 2 Open Mic workaround ***(WORK IN PROGRESS)***
- `$ sudo apt install pavucontrol`
- `$ pactl load-module module-combine-sink`
- now open pavucontrol and change beat hazard 2's output to be the new device
- at the bottom of pavucontrol, change "Show:" to be "All Streams"
- Increase the volume of the new device
- Under the playback tab of pavucontrol, change the input of Spotify to be "Simultaneous output to Built-in Audio Analog Stereo"
- Under the Recording tab of pavucontrol, change the input sink to be "Monitor Source of Simultaneous output to Built-in Audio Analog Stereo"
- to later remove the device, to remove the device: `$ pactl unload-module module-combine-sink`
- NOTE: be sure to mute _playback_ of the new device, otherwise you'll get ugly double-audio issues (don't mute it's input!)
